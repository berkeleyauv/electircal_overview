# Underwater Robotics @ Berkeley Electrical Team
Hello there! Welcome to the UR@B electrical team! 

## First Steps:
- Your first step is to join our slack which is the main communication channel. 
    - Link: https://urobotics.studentorg.berkeley.edu/intro-projects/ 
    - Slack Link: https://join.slack.com/t/ur-berkeley/shared_invite/zt-2phs77lb6-keu0un9WhQm8T3OZfLKsSg
    - If the link doesn't work, please ask
- Join the "Electronics" channel in slack.
- Create a github.com account 

## Electrical Overview
As the electrical team, we handle all the tasks related to the electronics side such as PCB design and creating the associated firmware. 

## Becoming a full electrical member:
- Express Interest
- Undergo the introductory training and project (Optional)
    - Training Link: https://github.com/berkeleyauv/electrical_training
    - Note: As of now, the project is optional
- Maintain participation 
- Estimated Workload = 3-10 hours per week
    - During the exam seasons, there will be less pressure.
    - We may frontload the work in antipation of exam season.
